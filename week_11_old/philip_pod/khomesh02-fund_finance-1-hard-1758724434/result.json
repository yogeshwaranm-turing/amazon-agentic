Let me explain the approval process for updating instrument prices.\n\nBased on our system requirements, updating instrument prices requires dual approval from both the Fund Manager and the Compliance Officer, in addition to your Finance Officer authorization. Here's how the approval process works:\n\n1. **Fund Manager Approval**: This approval ensures that any changes to instrument pricing align with the fund's investment strategy and risk parameters. The Fund Manager needs to review and approve the price changes before they can be implemented.\n\n2. **Compliance Officer Approval**: This approval ensures that the price updates comply with regulatory requirements and internal compliance policies. The Compliance Officer needs to verify that the changes are appropriate and properly documented.\n\nWhen you're ready to make the update, you'll need to:\n1. Gather the instrument ID (which we can find using the ticker symbol)\n2. Identify the specific price record that needs updating\n3. Obtain written or system-confirmed approval from both the Fund Manager and Compliance Officer\n4. Provide these approvals when executing the price update\n\nOnce you have the instrument details, I can help you locate the specific price record for November 26, 2024, and guide you through the update process with the proper approvals.\n\nWould you like me to help you look up the instrument information when you have the ticker symbol available?"
