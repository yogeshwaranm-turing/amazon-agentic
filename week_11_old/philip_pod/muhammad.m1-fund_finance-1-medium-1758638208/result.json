Here are the details:\n\n- Portfolio ID: 12\n- Current Status: Inactive\n- Investor ID: 12 (Collins-Nguyen)\n\nTo reactivate this portfolio, we'll need to update its status from \"inactive\" to \"active\". As you mentioned you have confirmation for reactivation, we can proceed with this update.\n\nTo update the portfolio status, I'll need to know if you have Fund Manager approval for this action, as it's required for portfolio updates.\n\nCould you please confirm:\n1. Do you have Fund Manager approval for reactivating this portfolio?\n2. Would you like me to proceed with reactivating the portfolio (changing status from \"inactive\" to \"active\")?"
