Request that they provide approval for onboarding Li Mu as an investor.\n\n3. Once you have their approval and email, we can proceed with the onboarding process.\n\nSince you don't have access to the Compliance Officer's email right now, I'm unable to proceed with creating the investor profile for Li Mu. The regulatory requirements mandate that all investor onboarding activities must have explicit Compliance Officer approval before we can create the investor record in our system.\n\nWould you like me to transfer you to a human agent who might be able to help you locate the appropriate Compliance Officer contact information or provide alternative guidance?"
