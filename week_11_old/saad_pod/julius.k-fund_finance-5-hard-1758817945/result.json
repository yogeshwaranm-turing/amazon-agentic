The cost basis is necessary for accurate portfolio valuation and reporting, and the Fund Manager approval ensures proper authorization as required by our compliance policies.\n\nWould you be able to obtain the cost basis and the Fund Manager approval before we proceed? Alternatively, I can help you find the current cost basis if you'd like to keep it the same."

The new quantity of units (which you mentioned is 2,514.6073)\n\nOnce you have the Fund Manager approval, I'll be able to help you update the holding with the new quantity while maintaining the same cost basis.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about this process in the meantime?"
