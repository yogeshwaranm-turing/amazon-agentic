Check your email signature or account settings to find your email address\n2.

In our system, I can only process the subscription once I have confirmation of his approval. \n\nTo proceed with creating the subscription, we would need:\n1. Confirmation of fund manager approval from Daniel Landry\n2. Your compliance officer approval (which you've already provided)\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Contact Daniel Landry separately to obtain his approval and then come back to me with that confirmation?\n2.
