This is a required field for the upload process. Without it, I can't proceed with the document upload.\n\nWould you be able to provide your user ID? Alternatively, if you'd prefer, I can transfer you to a human agent who might be able to assist with this process using other verification methods."

The system needs to know who is uploading the document for audit trail purposes.\n\nOnce you have your user ID, please feel free to return to this conversation, and I'll be happy to help you complete the upload of your \"TRADES_CSB_2024.csv\" document.\n\nIs there anything else related to investor reports or other financial documentation that I can assist you with in the meantime?"
