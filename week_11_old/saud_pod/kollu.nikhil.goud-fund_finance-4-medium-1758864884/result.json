This commitment will now be tracked in the system and can be fulfilled when appropriate.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about this commitment or any other actions you'd like to take regarding it?"

Here are the ways you can retrieve this record later:\n\n1. **Direct Lookup**: Use the commitment ID (2001) with the lookup_investment_flow_entities tool to directly retrieve this specific commitment record.\n\n2. **Filter Search**: You can also search for it by filtering investment flow entities using criteria such as:\n   - fund_id: 43 (for Wood, Tran and Cooper Value Fund)\n   - investor_id: 12 (for Collins-Nguyen)\n   - commitment_date: 2025-09-23\n   - status: pending\n\n3. **Audit Trail**: All changes to this commitment record are automatically tracked in the system's audit trail. You can access the audit history using the lookup_system_entities tool with the entity type \"audit_trails\" and filtering by reference_id: 2001 and reference_type: \"commitment\".\n\nThe system maintains a comprehensive audit trail for all financial records, including creation timestamps, user actions, and any modifications made to the commitment throughout its lifecycle. This ensures full regulatory compliance and transparency for audit purposes.\n\nWould you like me to demonstrate how to retrieve this specific commitment record using one of these methods?"
