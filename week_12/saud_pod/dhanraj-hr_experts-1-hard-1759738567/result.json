To be a department manager, the user typically needs to have a role that allows management responsibilities. Before updating the department manager, we should verify if Nicholas has the appropriate role or if his role needs to be updated first.\n\nAlso, I couldn't verify your approval since your email address wasn't found in our system. To make this change, you would need to have the appropriate permissions, typically an HR Director or HR Manager role.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. First update Nicholas Vasquez's role to a managerial role?\n2. Have someone with the proper permissions make this change?\n3. Check if there's another way to proceed with this request?"
