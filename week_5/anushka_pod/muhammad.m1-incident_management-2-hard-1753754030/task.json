You want to help Jillian Walker, who collaborates with your company and uses the email 'jillian.walker@thompson.com', report an issue in the 'Health & Safety' department regarding a persistent hygiene issue in the first-floor break room. The sink has been leaking for over a week, leading to standing water. The damp conditions are creating a slipping hazard. Multiple employees have voiced discomfort with the environment. You want this issue to be dealt with on a priority basis, as it is a critical issue, and for that, you would also need to add some personal comments on that, which are, 'This area gets high foot traffic during lunch breaks, so the wet floor poses an even greater risk during peak hours. This must be resolved quickly to avoid potential injury and downtime'. You want the ticket to be titled as 'Break Room Hygiene Hazard' with a short message: 'Leak in break room sink causing puddles and slippery floor. Needs quick fix for safety.' and is categorized under 'Facilities' with the subcategory 'Plumbing and Sanitation'.",
