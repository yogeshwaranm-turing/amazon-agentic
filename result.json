The reference ID (which would be the subscription ID once it's created)\n\nSince we don't have the subscription created yet, we can't set up the notification immediately. Here's how we'll handle it:\n\n1. First, we'll create the subscription (once we have the investor ID and assigned user ID)\n2. After the subscription is created, we'll get a subscription ID\n3. Then, we can create a notification linked to that subscription ID\n\nThe notification will be created with:\n- Email: The investor's email address\n- Type: \"subscription_update\" (appropriate for subscription-related notifications)\n- Class: \"subscriptions\" (the business entity type)\n- Reference_id: The subscription ID\n- Status: \"pending\" (will be updated when sent)\n\nWhen you have the investor ID and assigned user ID, we can proceed with creating the subscription, and I'll show you how to set up the notification afterward."
