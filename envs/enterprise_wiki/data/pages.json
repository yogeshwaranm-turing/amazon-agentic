    "content": "# System Architecture Overview\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the enterprise system architecture, including high-level design principles, component interactions, data flow patterns, and scalability considerations. The architecture is designed to support high availability, scalability, and maintainability while ensuring security and performance requirements are met.\n\n## Architectural Principles\n\n### Design Philosophy\n\nOur architecture follows several key principles that guide all design decisions:\n\n#### Microservices Architecture\n- **Service Decomposition**: Application functionality is decomposed into loosely coupled, independently deployable services\n- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services are organized around business domains and capabilities\n- **API-First Design**: All services expose well-defined APIs using RESTful or GraphQL patterns\n- **Service Autonomy**: Each service owns its data and business logic without tight coupling\n\n#### Cloud-Native Design\n- **Container-First**: All applications are designed to run in containerized environments\n- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure is defined and managed through code\n- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Infrastructure components are replaced rather than modified\n- **Declarative Configuration**: System state is described declaratively rather than imperatively\n\n#### Scalability and Performance\n- **Horizontal Scaling**: System components scale out rather than up to handle increased load\n- **Stateless Design**: Application components maintain no server-side state between requests\n- **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running operations are handled asynchronously to improve responsiveness\n- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching reduces latency and improves performance\n\n## System

    "content": "# System Architecture Overview\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the enterprise system architecture, including high-level design principles, component interactions, data flow patterns, and scalability considerations. The architecture is designed to support high availability, scalability, and maintainability while ensuring security and performance requirements are met.\n\n## Architectural Principles\n\n### Design Philosophy\n\nOur architecture follows several key principles that guide all design decisions:\n\n#### Microservices Architecture\n- **Service Decomposition**: Application functionality is decomposed into loosely coupled, independently deployable services\n- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services are organized around business domains and capabilities\n- **API-First Design**: All services expose well-defined APIs using RESTful or GraphQL patterns\n- **Service Autonomy**: Each service owns its data and business logic without tight coupling\n\n#### Cloud-Native Design\n- **Container-First**: All applications are designed to run in containerized environments\n- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure is defined and managed through code\n- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Infrastructure components are replaced rather than modified\n- **Declarative Configuration**: System state is described declaratively rather than imperatively\n\n#### Scalability and Performance\n- **Horizontal Scaling**: System components scale out rather than up to handle increased load\n- **Stateless Design**: Application components maintain no server-side state between requests\n- **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running operations are handled asynchronously to improve responsiveness\n- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching reduces latency and improves performance\n\n## System

    "content": "# System Architecture Overview\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the enterprise system architecture, including high-level design principles, component interactions, data flow patterns, and scalability considerations. The architecture is designed to support high availability, scalability, and maintainability while ensuring security and performance requirements are met.\n\n## Architectural Principles\n\n### Design Philosophy\n\nOur architecture follows several key principles that guide all design decisions:\n\n#### Microservices Architecture\n- **Service Decomposition**: Application functionality is decomposed into loosely coupled, independently deployable services\n- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services are organized around business domains and capabilities\n- **API-First Design**: All services expose well-defined APIs using RESTful or GraphQL patterns\n- **Service Autonomy**: Each service owns its data and business logic without tight coupling\n\n#### Cloud-Native Design\n- **Container-First**: All applications are designed to run in containerized environments\n- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure is defined and managed through code\n- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Infrastructure components are replaced rather than modified\n- **Declarative Configuration**: System state is described declaratively rather than imperatively\n\n#### Scalability and Performance\n- **Horizontal Scaling**: System components scale out rather than up to handle increased load\n- **Stateless Design**: Application components maintain no server-side state between requests\n- **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running operations are handled asynchronously to improve responsiveness\n- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching reduces latency and improves performance\n\n## System
