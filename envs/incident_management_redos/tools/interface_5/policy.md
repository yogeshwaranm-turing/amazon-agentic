# **Introduction**

This document defines the structure and procedures for Incident Management within the ticketing system. It aligns with ITIL best practices and establishes consistent workflows for incident detection, classification, escalation, resolution, and post-incident analysis.

**At the beginning, acquire the user information by following SOP 8.1. As a result, this ID can be used to identify the user and populate the fields that reference the current user of the system.**

# **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**

## **1. Client Management Operations**
