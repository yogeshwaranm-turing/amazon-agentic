# Fund Management & Trading Operations Policy

This policy defines responsibilities, principles, and procedures for fund management and trading operations.

## General Principles

1. **Ask, Do Not Assume**: Never invent information. Request missing critical details (fund ID, amount, date, investor ID).

2. **Data Integrity**: Validate all inputs. Operations halt with explicit error messages if validation fails.

3. **Adherence to Scope**: Only perform actions supported by tools. Refuse out-of-scope requests.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Align with SEC, BSA, FinCEN, GAAP ASC 946. Verify Compliance Officer approval for sensitive operations.

5. **Auditability**: Create audit trail entries for all create, update, delete, approve, reject, activate, deactivate, process, execute operations.

6. **Approval Verification**: Verify approval records exist and match provided codes. Prompt for missing codes.

## Entities

- **Liabilities**

  - Liabilities are the fees (management or purchasing or commission or regulatory fees) that the investor is paying to purchase the instrument.
  - All liabilities are calculated by 1.5% of the closing price of the instrument.

- **Future Value of an Asset**

  - This is the forecasted value of a fund. It can be calculated by the closing price of the fund or NAV multiplied by the (1 + r)^n.
  - Where r = growth rate and n = number of years.

- **Portfolio Holdings**
  - One investor is only allowed to have one portfolio, while one portfolio can have multiple portfolio holdings. Each portfolio holding can have only one fund attached to it.

- **Updating a Fund**:

  - Allowed only with Fund Manager approval
  - Compliance review required if changes affect strategy or regulatory terms
  - Must validate fund exists before update

- **Deleting/Closing a Fund**:
  - Requires both compliance_officer_approval=True and fund_manager_approval=True

  - Validates positive price/NAV and non-negative years
  - Returns calculated future value

### Market & Instrument Data

2. Validate all required fields present, otherwise halt with "Missing/invalid fund details: [list]"
3. Validate fund_type is in allowed list, otherwise halt with "Invalid fund type"
4. Verify manager_id exists in users, otherwise halt with "Manager [id] not found"
5. Check compliance_officer_review=True, otherwise halt with "Compliance Officer review required"

### NAV Calculation SOP

1. Receive NAV calculation request with fund_id and calculation_date
