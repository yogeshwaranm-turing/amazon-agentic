After this new version is created, add a section at the bottom of the guide: 'For performance reviews, please see the Official Performance Review Minutes.'. If the guide has no child pages, make 'Meeting Minutes - Part 306' its child and remove the 'draft' label from the 'Meeting Minutes - Part 306' page.
