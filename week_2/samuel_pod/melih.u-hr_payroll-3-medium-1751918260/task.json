Amanda has been on administrative leave and is now returning with new banking requirements and consultant fees that need processing. Start by retrieving the most recent payroll breakdown for run ID 'c1b3e4f5-a2d6-7890-1234-567890fedcba' to understand the current compensation structure and identify any outstanding payment obligations. Next, establish a new international financial provider called 'SwiftPay International' based in Switzerland that supports CHF and EUR currencies to handle Amanda's new banking preferences for cross-border transactions. Update Amanda's worker banking information to use the new SwiftPay International provider with account number '7766554433' and CHF currency for her compensation payments. Create a priority consulting invoice for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3200 due on 2025-08-15 for specialized compliance training services that Amanda completed during her leave period. Finally, immediately process payment for this consulting invoice to complete her administrative return and ensure all financial obligations are settled before her official work resumption.",
