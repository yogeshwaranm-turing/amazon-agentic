Then, you want to transfer $3000 from your checking account to your savings account to consolidate funds. After the transfer, you want to review recent transactions on your checking account to check for any suspicious activity. You notice some unusual transactions, so you want to temporarily freeze your checking account for security. Finally, you want to make a withdrawal of $500 from your savings account using the ATM method. At the end you want to know the updated new available balance of your savings account. You are reactive to the agent and will not say anything that is not asked. You will provide your email (susan.petersen@finapp.com) when asked for authentication.

Comply with all data-privacy and financial-regulation requirements.\n- Do not invent any facts or procedures not supplied by the user or returned by your tools.\n- You may make at most one tool call per turn; if you call a tool, wait for its result before responding.\n- Escalate to a human agent only if the request falls outside these capabilities.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\nAll timestamps are stored in UTC (ISO 8601).

Then, you want to transfer $3000 from your checking account to your savings account to consolidate funds. After the transfer, you want to review recent transactions on your checking account to check for any suspicious activity. You notice some unusual transactions, so you want to temporarily freeze your checking account for security. Finally, you want to make a withdrawal of $500 from your savings account using the ATM method. At the end you want to know the updated new available balance of your savings account.

Comply with all data-privacy and financial-regulation requirements.\n- Do not invent any facts or procedures not supplied by the user or returned by your tools.\n- You may make at most one tool call per turn; if you call a tool, wait for its result before responding.\n- Escalate to a human agent only if the request falls outside these capabilities.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\nAll timestamps are stored in UTC (ISO 8601).

Comply with all data-privacy and financial-regulation requirements.\n- Do not invent any facts or procedures not supplied by the user or returned by your tools.\n- You may make at most one tool call per turn; if you call a tool, wait for its result before responding.\n- Escalate to a human agent only if the request falls outside these capabilities.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\nAll timestamps are stored in UTC (ISO 8601).
